# MySQL-and-MongoDB
For this project we create a database and perform some queries using both SQL (mySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB)

You can find the schema created with MySQL and the queries in two different version: one  naive and the other one optimized.

We also use MongoDB (pyMongo),as you can see in the file PyMongo.ipynb, Schema.ipynb and Preprocessing(1).ipynb.
